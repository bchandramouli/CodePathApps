This is an Adroid application for task lists (todos). 

Time spent: 8 hours 

Completed user stories:
    - Required: User can add/edit/delete todo items
    - Required: Persistent storage 
    - Optional: Persist todo into SQLite
    - Optional: Used a custom adapter
    - Optional: Used a dialog fragment for editing items
    - Optional: Allow users to enter priority for tasks (and display tasks sorted on priority in listview).

Notes (Next steps):
   - Working on adopting to ActiveAndroid ORM instead of SQLiteOpenHelper
   - Improving the UI looks.
   - Add the date picker option as a dialog fragment.
